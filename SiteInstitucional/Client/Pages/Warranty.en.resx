    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be very careful when handling oil pumps that have a retainer. The inner lips of the oil seal should not be touched, for if kneading, the oil seal will not seal appropriately and oil spill occurs;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never hold the oil pump in a vise or any other device that can damage the oil pump's body, because  kneading can cause locking of the internal gears or rotors;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check that the oil pump does not have any kneaded nor scratched areas caused by falls or hits, or oxidation (rust) caused by storage failure;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure the oil pump spins freely and has not sucked some dirt during handling;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure the pan is not kneaded in the region of the suction tube that could block the oil throughput or force the oil pump;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only install the oil pump after perfect cleaning of the lubrication system, because any impurity may lock oil pump rotors or gears, clog the suction tube screen or lock the overflow valve;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always use the oil as recommended by the engine manufacturer;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Load the oil pump and the filter with the same oil that will be used in the engine;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only use the gaskets, O-rings, screws, transfer tubes, etc. that come with the product in the packaging;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For gear driven oil pumps, check after assembly if they have the required free movement;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For groove driven pumps, check after assembly if the axial movement is free;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For pumps driven by the crankshaft, check for signs of wear on the dragging corners of the crankshaft's end. If there is any wear, it will be necessary to restore the worn area, to avoid oil pump locking and the consequent breakage of internal rotors. If the crankshaft is rectified, make sure that the hard layer (tempered) was not jeopardized (low hardness). If the hardness is low, a nitriding process treatment is recommended;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tighten the oil pump screws alternately and at the correct torque;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure that the flange surface of the suction tube is not with any damage, irregularity or out of flatness which may allow air entry. If the pump pulls air together with the oil, it will become foamy, oil pressure and engine lubrication will be jeopardized.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For proper maintenance of the lubrication system, it is also recommended to replace the suction tube, oil filter and relief valve (if not part of the oil pump) whenever replacing the oil pump.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Completely drain the cooling system;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After removing the water pump, clean the cooling system with clean water in order to remove scale and rust;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clean the rotor cavity and the seating surface of the water pump in the engine block or counter piece;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only use the gaskets, O-rings, screws, transfer tubes, etc. that come with the product in the packaging, without using glue or silicone. In cases where no gaskets or rings are applied, apply the minimum necessary sealant;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only install the water pump after perfect cleaning of the cooling system, for any impurity can damage the water pump seal, causing leakage of coolant;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Check that the water pump is spinning freely;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prepare the coolant with distilled or demineralized water and additive in proportion and specification specified by the engine manufacturer;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check that the thermostatic valve is not catching and if there are leaks in the cooling system;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check that fan and fan clutch (when used) are not defective;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check that the tensioner and the belt that drives the water pump are in perfect condition, because if the tensioner is too stretched or the belt is damaged, they may damage the water pump pulley and its bearing;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For proper maintenance of the cooling system, it is recommended to also replace the belt and tensioner when replacing the water pump.&lt;/li&gt;
